# JS Activity: Tip Calculator with drop down menu
Refactor `index.html` and `tip-calculator.js` so that Tip Rate is selected from a drop down menu.

## Instructions
1. Add a `select` menu to your Tip Calculator to select the tip rate based on level of service:
    - Poor Service: 12%
    - Adequate Service: 18%
    - Superb Service: 23%
2. Using your knowledge of conditional statements (`if`, `else if` and `else`) and comparison operators, assign `tipRate` based on the menu option selected.
3. Calculate the `billTotal` and print it to the `output` element of the form.
